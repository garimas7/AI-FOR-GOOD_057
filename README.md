## Project Overview

**Project URL**: [DSA Algorithm Visualizer](https://66d49d49b075bd0e02642185--sunny-torte-375088.netlify.app/)

The **DSA Algorithm Visualizer** is a web application that allows users to interactively visualize various data structures and algorithms. It provides step-by-step animations of algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal, helping users understand how these algorithms function. The platform supports:

- **Sorting Algorithms** (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort)
- **Searching Algorithms** (e.g., Binary Search)
- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., BFS, DFS)
- **Data Structures** (e.g., Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- **Algorithmic Techniques** (e.g., Two Pointer, Sliding Window)
- **User Interface** with interactive visualizations
